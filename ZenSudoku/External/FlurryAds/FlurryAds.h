 *  That button should only be displayed if this method returns YES.
 * 
 *  @note If this method returns YES, you are guranteed an ad will be available when you attempt to display an ad with the same parameters. \n
    The @c space simply represents the placement of the ad in your app and should be 
 *  unique for each placement. For example, if you are displaying a full screen ad on your 
 *  splash screen and after level completeion, you may have the following spaces 
 *  @c @"SPLASH_AD" and @c @"LEVEL_AD".
 *

 *  @param size The default size of an ad space. This can be overriden on the server. See @c FlurryAdSize in the FlurryAds.h file for allowable values.
